      You come up on a tower. From the distance, it looks stone-hewn. You can
      see the individual bricks in the masonry. But on closer inspection, the
      tower looks as though it's made of the roots you saw beneath your feet.
      They twist and pack themselves into roughly-rectangular shapes to mimic
      the bricks. But it is definitely made of wood.

      Justin tries to clime the tower. He makes it two thirds of the way up and
      falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenn reaches up and casts Fly on him. He makes it to the top of the tower.
      She casts it on Taylor and herself, and they all reach the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the tower is a trap door. It looks like it's made of the
      roots, as well. Even the hinges are made of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath the trapdoor is a small room, lit by a window in the wall. The
      twilight brings a glow to the inside. There's some wooden furniture.
    </p>
    <p>Once you all make it inside, the trapdoor closes itself</p>
    <p>
      The window gets smaller... smaller. Til it's a pinpoint. The twilight
      leaves the interior. A slight shift and the floor moves underneath you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room begins to gradually get smaller. The room is dark, but Taylor can
      see a table. On the table lays a book, ornately decorated with gold
      script. It's a large "O"
    </p>
    <p>Justin reads the book. Nothing.</p>
    <p>Taylor reads the book. He understands it. A spell. Knock.</p>
    <p>
      You open the trap door with the spell and fly out. The tower is warm. You
      float down. It's no longer a tower, but a large, branchless, leafless
      tree.
