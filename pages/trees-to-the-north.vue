      You make your way towards the woods. As you approach, the trees seem to
      stretch up towards the sky. By the time you stand at the edge of the
      forest, they almost entirely block out the twilight, stretching impossibly
      high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roots tangle the ground here. You see one with a slight green glow to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see across a small clearing, a
      <nuxt-link to="/the-tower-beyond-the-trees">tall tower</nuxt-link> shoots
      high into the sky.
