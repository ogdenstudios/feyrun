      Opposite the sun is a dirt trail, twisting and winding away from the
      clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you make your way through the trail, you look up and see floating
      lights. They remind you of paper lanterns, but they aren't connected to
      anything and they don't float entirely off into the sky. They mostly drift
      and bob up and down.
    </p>
    <p>The grass around your knees swirls, but you feel no wind.</p>
    <p>
      The trail opens up to a circular crossing. There's a path to the left and
      to the right. A figure is laying on the far side of the crossing from you,
      leaning into the grass and smoking a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His feet have hooves, his legs are covered in fur, but above his waist is
      a humanoid form, except for the horns on his head. He doesn't seem to take
      much notice of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offers to make a deal. He draws a deck of cards. If you can predict the
      top card more than he can, he'll tell you the safest path to take. If not,
      you'll help him move his goods.

      Taylor plays the game. He uses his Portent ability to win. The creature
      follows through on the deal:
