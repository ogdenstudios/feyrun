      You're transported to a valley full of wild, tall grass. Waking up is like
      when you&#39;re stirring from a deep sleep and you can&#39;t quite figure
      out if you&#39;ve already woken up or not. You blink, look around, find
      darkness again.
    </p>
    <p>They blink once more. It&#39;s sunrise.</p>
    <p>Another blink. The sun sets. Or... has it moved at all?</p>
    <p>
      You come to consciousness. Your vision, once blurry, sharpens. The sun is
      in the same position and you're staring into a deep purple and red
      twilight. Full of twinkling stars. The grass blows in the wind around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's something strange about the grass. It seems like every blade of
      grass moves at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun hasn't moved since you last looked up. It hasn't moved since the
      first time you remember it. So it's impossible to tell which direction
      you're facing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you look to the North, or maybe the South, you see a forest of
      <nuxt-link to="trees-to-the-north">tall, skinny trees.</nuxt-link>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the
      <nuxt-link to="pitch-black-valley">direction of the sun</nuxt-link> you
      see fog slowly wisping up from the cusp of the hills. It almost seems to
      be... climbing up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the opposite direction of the sun, you see a
      <nuxt-link to="the-crossing-to-the-east">road</nuxt-link>.
    </p>
    <p>Justin walks into the fog.</p>
    <p>
      Jenn waits what feels like an awfully long time. She convinces Taylor to
      go after the other figure who disappeared.
