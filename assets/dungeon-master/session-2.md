# Amber waves of grain

You set off through a field of waving, amber grains towards what you think is "the market". In the distance you can see stone-hewn walls and parapets. It looks like perhaps a proper city.

> Do you want some time now in-character or out-of-character to make any plans, chat, discuss? A reminder, for this session, you can use any ability you know about at-will. 

They talk a little bit about what's going on with them. Strange territory. Getting into a big city full of people they don't know. 

Jenn wants to be cautious. 

Jenn asks - what do both of them remember? 

## The gates of Svartalfheim

> Halt! State your name, your court, and your purpose 

* If they remember "summer court", or if Jenn summons her sprite who reminds them of it, they're taken by guards to a holding cell. Oberon comes to pick them up. 

* If they somehow think "winter court", they're also sent to a holding cell. Champions of the Summer Court come to pick them up. They bring them to Oberon. 

* If they don't remember, the guard says: 

> Wyldfae, are ye? These are troubled times, and we've no room for troublemakers in Svartalfheim. No entry! * this one

## The holding cell and Oberon 

> Something has gone afoul. Our enemies have gained a foothold we never knew possible. Queen Mab has claimed Chateau Faire for herself - a stronghold we've held since the dawn of time. I don't know if we have the strength to take it back, but I've brought you all here to help. 

The sound of armored footsteps approach down the hall 

> My child, there isn't time to explain. The Korreds, they deal in gold. Take this, buy what supplies you must, and when you are ready, come back to this place. But... best not be seen, yes?
