# Amber waves of grain

You set off through a field of waving, amber grains towards what you think is "the market". In the distance you can see stone-hewn walls and parapets. It looks like perhaps a proper city. 

> Do you want some time now in-character or out-of-character to make any plans, chat, discuss? A reminder, for this session, you can use any ability you know about at-will. 

## The gates of Svartalfheim

> Halt! State your name, your court, and your purpose 

* If they remember "summer court", or if Jenn summons her sprite who reminds them of it, they're taken by guards to a holding cell. Oberon comes to pick them up. 

* If they somehow think "winter court", they're also sent to a holding cell. Champions of the Summer Court come to pick them up. They bring them to Oberon. 

* If they don't remember, the guard says: 

> Wyldfae, are ye? These are troubled times, and we've no room for troublemakers in Svartalfheim. No entry! 

* Jenn can remember to use fly to get them over the walls. 

* If they fly over the walls or otherwise break in, the guard are summoned and bind them in iron chains. Oberon comes to their aid in the holding cell. 

> Jenn and Oberon have a moment. He reminds her of her name. He can't say everything there, who knows what spies abound. She remembers Otherworldly Patron. 

## The holding cell and Oberon 

> Something has gone afoul. Our enemies have gained a foothold we never knew possible. Queen Mab has claimed Chateau Faire for herself - a stronghold we've held since the dawn of time. I don't know if we have the strength to take it back, but I've brought you all here to help. 

The sound of armored footsteps approach down the hall 

> My child, there isn't time to explain. The Korreds, they deal in gold. Take this, buy what supplies you must, and when you are ready, come back to this place. But... best not be seen, yes?

* He hands them a pouch of 500 gold 

## Departing Svartalfheim 

> The Queen can't know I've brought you here. It's possible too many have seen you already. My child, you must disguise yourself. 

* Jenn remembers she has `Mask of Many Faces`. 

> You sir! (He points to Taylor). I've brought a present for you 

* It's a spellbook containing `Disguise self`. 

> You, my newtish friend. Come here. Look into this mirrored pool. 

* He pulls Justin to a barrel full of water and stuffs him in. He locks it. Justin remembers he has `Hold Breath`. 

> Help with the barrel, don't be slow, he can only hold his breath so long. 

You load it onto the wagon and they take off.
