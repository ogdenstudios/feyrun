# An overview of the campaign 

## The fall of the Summer Court 

Queen Mab of the Winter Court made an alliance with the Far Beings. Typically soldiers coming back from the Far Gates have their memories erased to scrub the influence of the Far Beings. 

But Queen Mab grew tired of her perpetual loss to the Summer Court. She suspected she might have something to learn from the Far Beings. 

She held parlay with them and bargained free passage through the Winter lands into the Shadowfell in return for a cease-fire at the Far Gates. (This requires an act of a god and a crossing of the Feywild and Shadowfell). 

Imix - Justin's peoples' old god and current nemesis. He comes from a village burned by Asgaroth, Imix's Pit Fiend minion. Imix has designs on the plane of fire and means to throw the planes into chaos in order to achieve his goal. 

She amassed her soldiers outside Chateau Faire and claimed it for herself.

## The Summer Protector Uzdur

Uzdur is an Archfey with no known backstory, but has bad blood with Oberon. He maintains a small keep in Svartalfheim, as he has purchased citizenship through some means. 

Uzdur was able to offer Asylum to the inner cirrcle of the Summer Court. They reluctantly accepted his assistance. 

## Oberon's plot 

Oberon cannot bear to be indebted to Uzdur, nor can he bear to see his love Titania in Uzdur's household. He hatched a plot to restore the balance of the Feywild using some assistance from mortals of the Material plane.
