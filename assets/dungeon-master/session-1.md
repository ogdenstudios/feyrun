# Memories from a the Prime Material

The adventurers are transported to a valley full of wild, tall grass. Waking up is like when you're stirring from a deep sleep and you can't quite figure out if you've already woken up or not. They blink, look around, find darkness again. 

They blink once more. It's sunrise. 

Another blink. The sun sets. Or... has it moved at all?

* Halyyra succeeds: she remembers a name, Oberon. 
* Calwor succeeds: he remembers stuffing a small scroll in his pocket

You come to consciousness. Your vision, once blurry, sharpens. The sun is in the same position and you're staring into a deep purple and red twilight. Full of twinkling stars. The grass blows in the wind around you. 

There's something strange about the grass. It seems like every blade of grass moves at once. 

Halyyra, you look to your right and see a gnome, also stirring. Calwor, to your left is a human... or maybe an elf? 

BLANK, you wake up as well. You see the others, but you're on a small hill. Between you and them, a still pond. It reflects the twilight almost perfectly.
