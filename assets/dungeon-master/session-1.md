# Memories from a the Prime Material

The adventurers are transported to a valley full of wild, tall grass. Waking up is like when you're stirring from a deep sleep and you can't quite figure out if you've already woken up or not. They blink, look around, find darkness again. 

They blink once more. It's sunrise. 

Another blink. The sun sets. Or... has it moved at all?

> Perform a constitution check. DC 10. 

- Tay: 13+1
- Jenn: 5 + 3
- Justin: 10 + 3

* Agarax succeeds: he remembers fire. First screaming. Then laughter, hideous laughter. (The laughter of the pit fiend Asgaroth)
* Calwor succeeds: he remembers stuffing a small scroll in his pocket
* Halyyra succeeds: she remembers a name, Oberon. 

> Calwor, roll two d20s and record the numbers

## Calwor's spells

If Calwor remembers his scroll, it has three spells written on it: 

1. Protection from Evil and Good
2. Jump
3. Levitate
 
## Enter the Feywild

You come to consciousness. Your vision, once blurry, sharpens. The sun is in the same position and you're staring into a deep purple and red twilight. Full of twinkling stars. The grass blows in the wind around you. 

There's something strange about the grass. It seems like every blade of grass moves at once. 

Halyyra, you look to your right and see a gnome, also stirring. Calwor, to your left is a human... or maybe an elf? 

BLANK, you wake up as well. You see the others, but you're on a small hill. Between you and them, a still pond. It reflects the twilight almost perfectly. 

> Some skill challenge to make it over to them, or Calwor can help out with his spells.

- Justin makes an investigation check: 3 + 1


## Where are we? 

The sun hasn't moved since you last looked up. It hasn't moved since the first time you remember it. So it's impossible to tell which direction you're facing. 

But if you look to the North, or maybe the South, you see a forest of tall, skinny trees. 

> A perception check DC 20 will have the trees part and reveal the tower in the distance

- Jenn: 13+1 

In the direction of the sun, where Justin was, you see fog slowly wisping up from the cusp of the hills. It almost seems to be... climbing up the hill. 

And in the opposite direction of the sun, you see a light trail. 

> A perception check DC 15 will revela a fork in the road. 

## The Tower Beyond the Trees

You make your way towards the woods (or the tower if they saw it). As you approach, the trees seem to stretch up towards the sky. By the time you stand at the edge of the forest, they almost entirely block out the twilight, stretching impossibly high. 

Roots tangle the ground here. 

> A perception check DC 10 will reveal a root with a slight green glow to it. It leads them to a the tower by the climbing tree. A failure will have the trees part and show the way to the base of the tower. 

- Taylor: 16 + 0

- Justin: makes a nature check 15 + 4 to investigate the root

### The base of the tower

You come up on a tower. From the distance, it looks stone-hewn. You can see the individual bricks in the masonry. But on closer inspection, the tower looks as though it's made of the roots you saw beneath your feet. They twist and pack themselves into roughly-rectangular shapes to mimic the bricks. But it is definitely made of wood. 

- Justin walks around and investigates: 14 + 1
- Jenn walks around and investigates: 2 + 4

> They can try climbing. Three checks: DC 5, DC 15, DC 25

- Justin tries to climb first: 

1. 8 + 1
2. 16 + 1 
3. 5 + 1

Jenn makes a perception check: 18 + 1 
Taylor makes a perception check: 13 + 0

Whoever falls first, Halyyra will cast fly on them instinctually to the top. 

### The climbing tree

The glowing root follows its way to a large, round tree. As you approach, it shifts and creaks. It bends towards you and branches along its trunk seem to curl upwards. They look like handholds. 

You can see across a small clearing, a tall tower shoots high into the sky. 

> No DC to climb, they can easily make it up to be even with the tower. 

You make it to the very top of the tree, almost eye level to the tower. 

> Someone can make a DC 20 athletics check to jump to the tower. Anyone who falls get fly cast on them by Halyyra. If no one jumps, a strong breeze knocks Halyyra from the tree. 

### Inside the tower

At the top of the tower is a trap door. It looks like it's made of the roots, as well. Even the hinges are made of wood. 

> They can open the trapdoor.

Underneath the trapdoor is a small room, lit by a window in the wall. The twilight brings a glow to the inside. There's some wooden furniture. 

> Once the last of them is inside, the trapdoor closes itself. 

On the table lays a book, ornately decorated with gold script. 

> Calwor can read the book, it contains the spell, Knock

The window gets smaller... smaller. Til it's a pinpoint. The twilight leaves the interior. A slight shift and the floor moves underneath you. 

The room begins to gradually get smaller. Anyone with darkvision can see, but they know the light has gone. Calwor must use knock to reopen the trapdoor. 

> Jenn and Taylor have Darkvision

## The Pitch Black Valley

You walk towards the hill where Justin appeared at first. You step with trepidation, worried that the distance may play tricks with you once more. 

This time you can walk directly to your destination. As you crest the hill, the fog swirls... almost faster. It seems to lap at your ankles. You look down, but can't see past it. 

Jenn, as you stare into the fog, it begins to clear? No - it's not clearing, but your vision is coming into focus. 

> Jenn learns she knows Devil's sight, which allows her to see through magical darkness. 

Jenn, you can see a village, shrouded in wisps of fog. Whereas your surroundings are rich with color, the village below seems devoid of it all. Perhaps it's the fog, but the richness is certainly gone. 

> If they walk through, they experience a brief sensation, once more of falling. 

Without warning, they're standing in the middle of the village. Everyone can see now, but truly, the color is gone from the world around you. There are buildings around here, and they are covered in whisps of fog... or perhaps smoke?

> If anyone except Agarax attempts to enter or touch the fog, he has a memory and quickly leaps to his feat to pull them away. The person takes 1d6 fire damage, but he takes none. He learns he has the Child of Imix feature.

Agarax, you feel extremely uneasy. 

> If they turn back, they find the hill is gone. 

A deep, hideous laughter rolls from all directions. 

> Agarax... 

### Semi-divine intervention

> Jenn's sprite appears. "There's no time to explain! You shouldn't be here! Follow me!" They all run with the sprite. They look back to the village, but it's covered in thicker fog. When they look ahead again, they're just cresting the hill once more.

## The Crossing in the East 

Justin leads out of the forest: 11 + 4 

Opposite the sun is a dirt trail, twisting and winding away from the clearing. 

> If they see the fork in the road, one runs to the left, one to the right.

As you make your way through the trail, you look up and see floating lights. They remind you of paper lanterns, but they aren't connected to anything and they don't float entirely off into the sky. They mostly drift and bob up and down. 

The grass around your knees swirls, but you feel no wind. 

The trail opens up to a circular crossing. There's a path to the left and to the right. A figure is laying on the far side of the crossing from you, leaning into the grass and smoking a pipe. 

His feet have hooves, his legs are covered in fur, but above his waist is a humanoid form, except for the horns on his head. He doesn't seem to take much notice of you. 

> If the group passes by, Dantares shouts to them "Are you sure that's the right way?" 

If they ask him for help, he offers to make a deal. 

He draws a deck of cards. If they can predict the top card more than he can, he'll tell them the safest path to take. (A trick - the safest path is one you know well). If not, they'll help him move his goods (he points to a sack of potatoes, but he really means all of his goods forever. He is a merchant, looking for servants to carry his goods). 

Use Calwor's Portent ability to try and beat the rolls. Two out of three, best rolls win. 

If anyone but Calwor attempts the game, a small tug at their sleeve holds them back. It's Halyyra's sprite, who appears and helps warn them. 

### Calwor wins

If Calwor wins the game, Dantares tells him "the safest path to take is the one you know well". 

He scampers off, back to his farm. Halyyra's sprite stops them if they attempt to chase after. They speak: 

"This is my home. I don't know how you got here. Usually I come to you, but somehow you've come to me. It's too dangerous for you here. You don't know the rules!" 

### Calwor loses 

They move the sack of potatoes back, when they get to the small farm, he shows them to their rooms. "Thank you so much for your help" 

## Semi-divine Intervention

Oberon steps in. If Halyyra remembers him, he leaves a note signed "-O". If she doesn't, he appears.

## Questions

Jenn: Does Oberon sound familiar to her?

Yes

Justin: Who is the sprite they met? 

The sprite from Jenn's pact of the chain. 

Taylor: What's the market? 

An impermanent settlement where local farmers and merchants sell their wares.
